# lucky-birthday-or-not
This program ask the user to input his/her birthdate and his/her lucky number<br>
then it adds the sum of the digits of Dob and divides it with the lucky number<br>
if the Sum is completly divisible by the lucky number then its a lucky birthday otherwise not<br>

Note: This was a fun app by the way, because we are programmers and we believe in logics not luck. Cheers
